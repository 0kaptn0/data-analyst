Flight Delay Time Statistics Dashboard
This project is an interactive dashboard built using Python, Dash, and Plotly to visualize flight delay statistics for U.S. airlines. The dashboard provides insights into the average delay times categorized by various delay types (Carrier, Weather, NAS, Security, Late Aircraft) for each airline across different months of a selected year.

Features
Input a specific year to explore flight delay statistics.
Visualize delay trends with line charts for:
Carrier delays
Weather delays
NAS delays
Security delays
Late aircraft delays
Fully interactive with dynamic updates.
Technologies Used
Dash: For building the web application.
Plotly: For creating interactive visualizations.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Airline Dataset: Data sourced from U.S. Department of Transportation.
